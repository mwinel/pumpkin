# Application maintenance operations

Applications are generally amorphous and are deemed to evolve with time.
Both monolith and microservice-based applications transition in the maintenance phase after the production release.
When considering adding new functionalities or incorporating new tools, it is always beneficial to focus on extensibility rather than flexibility.
Generally speaking, it is more efficient to manage multiple services with a well-defined and simple functionality (as in the case of microservices), rather than add more abstraction layers to support new services (as weâ€™ve seen with the monoliths).
However, to have a well-structured maintenance phase, it is essential to understand the reasons an architecture is chosen for an application and involved trade-offs.

Some of the most encountered operations in the maintenance phase are listed below:

- A **split operation** which is applied if a service covers too many functionalities and it's complex to manage. Having smaller, manageable units is preferred in this context.
- A **merge operation** which is applied if units are too granular or perform closely interlinked operations, and it provides a development advantage to merge these. For example, merging 2 separate services for log output and log format in a single service.
- A **replace operation** which is adopted when a more efficient implementation is identified for service. For example, rewriting a Java service in JavaScript, to optimize the overall execution time.
- A **stale operation** which is performed for services that are no longer providing any business value, and should be archived or deprecated. For example, services that were used to perform a one-off migration process.

By performing any of these operations you increase the longevity and continuity of a given project.
Overall, the end goal is to ensure the application is providing value to customers and is easy to manage by the engineering team.
