# Best practices for Application Deployment

Regardless of the chosen architecture, a set of good development practices can be applied to improve the application lifecycle throughout the release and maintenance phases.
Adopting these practices increases resiliency, lowers the time to recovery, and provides transparency of how a service handles incoming requests.

In this section we look at some of the best practices that should be applied when developing an application that aims to be containerized.
These practices are focused on **health checks**, **metrics**, **logs**, **tracing**, and **resource consumption**.

### Health Checks

Health checks are implemented to showcase the **status** of an application.
These checks report if an application is running and meets the expected behavior to serve incoming traffic.

Usually, health checks are represented by an **_HTTP endpoint_** such as `/healthz` or `/status`.
These endpoints return an HTTP response showcasing if the application is healthy or in an error state.

Sample response object;

```
{
    result: "health"
}
```

or

```
{
    result: "error"
}
```

### Metrics

Metrics are necessary to understand the behavior and performance of an application.
To fully understand how a service handles requests, it is mandatory to collect statistics on how the service operates.
For example, the number of active users, handled requests, or the number of logins.
Additionally, it is important to gather statistics on resources that the application requires to be fully operational.
For example, the amount of CPU, memory, and network throughput.

Usually, the collection of metrics are returned via an **_HTTP endpoint_** such as `/metrics`, which contains the internal metrics such as the number of active users, consumed CPU, network throughput, etc.

Sample response object;

```
{
    result: {
        userCount: 400,
        activeUsers: 386,
        inActiveUsers: 2,
        successfulLoginsCount: 235,
        failedLoginsCount: 40,
    }
}
```

### Logs

Log aggregation provides valuable insights into what operations a service is performing at a point in time.
It is the nucleus of any troubleshooting and debugging process.
For example, it is essential to record if a user logged in successfully into a service, or encountered an error while performing a payment.

Usually, the logs are collected from **STDOUT (standard out)** and **STDERR (standard error)** through a passive logging mechanism.
This means that any output or errors from the application are sent to the shell.
Subsequently, these are collected by a logging tool, such as [Splunk](https://www.splunk.com/) or [Fluentd](https://www.fluentd.org/), and stored in backend storage.

However, your application can also send the logs directly to the backend storage.
In this case, an active logging technique is used, as the log transmission is handled directly by the application, without a logging tool required.

There are multiple logging levels that can be attributed to an operation. Some of the most widely used are:

- **DEBUG** which records fine-grained events of application processes.
- **INFO** which provides coarse-grained information about a given operation such as a user trying to login.
- **WARN** which records a potential issue with the service such as user multiple logins from different devices.
- **ERROR** which notifies an error has been encountered, however, the application is still running.
- **FATAL** which represents a critical situation, when the application is not operational.

It is also a best practice to associate each log line with a timestamp, that will exactly record when an operation was invoked.

Sample response object;

```
{
    result: {
        date: "2022-03-15 03:15:23",
        severity: "ERROR",
        msg: "Login failed for user BOB"
    }
}
```

### Tracing

Tracing is capable of creating a full picture of how different services are invoked to fulfill a single request.
Usually, tracing is integrated through a library at the application layer, where the developer can record when a particular service is invoked.

These records for individual services are defined as **spans**.
_A collection of spans define a trace that recreates the entire lifecycle of a request._

### Resource Consumption

Resource consumption entails the resources an application requires to be fully operational.
This usually refers to the amount of CPU and memory that is consumed by an application during its execution.
Additionally, it is beneficial to benchmark the network throughput, or how many requests can an application handle concurrently.
Having awareness of resource boundaries is essential to ensure that the application is up and running 24/7.
