# Exercise 3: Logging

Logging is a core factor in increasing the visibility and transparency of an application.
When in troubleshooting or debugging scenarios, it is very important to pin-point the functionality that impacted the service.

In this exercise you will focus on bringing the logging capabilities to the previous application in Exercise 2.

- A log line should be recorded when the `localhost:8080/` endpoint is accessed.
- The logs should be stored in a file named `log.txt` in the same directory as the application.
- The log line should be formatted as follows: `[timestamp] [level] [message]`
- The timestamp should be formatted as `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS`
- The level should be formatted as `[INFO]` or `[ERROR]`
- The message should be formatted as `GET / <success or error message>`
