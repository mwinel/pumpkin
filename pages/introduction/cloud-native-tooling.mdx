# Cloud Native Tooling

With the usage of multiple containers it was imperative to introduce a tool that would help manage containers at scale. 
With time a number of tools have been developed, such as;

- [Docker Swarm](https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/)
- [Apache Mesos](https://mesos.apache.org/)
- [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/)

However in this guide we shall be working with Kubernetes. 
Kubernetes had its first initial release in 2014 and it derives from Borg, a Google open-source container orchestrator. 
Currently, Kubernetes is part of ***[Cloud Native Computing Foundation](), (CNCF)***. 
CNCF was founded in 2015, and it provides a vendor-neutral home to open-source projects such as;

- Kubernetes
- Prometheus
- ETCD
- Envoy and many more.

Kubernetes is a container orchestrator that ***automates*** the configuration, management, and scalability of an application.
Overtime Kubernetes capabilities were further extended to integrate with tools that provide functionality such as;

- **Runtime** for application execution requirement
- **Network** for application connectivity
- **Storage** for application resources
- **Service Mesh** for the granular control of traffic within a cluster
- **Logs and Metrics** for increased visibility within an application
- and **Tracing** for building the full request journey.
