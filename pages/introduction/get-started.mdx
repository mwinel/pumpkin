# Get Started

Throughout this guideline, we will walk through a realistic example, apply good development practices, containerize our application, and finally deploy it to a Kubernetes cluster using an automated CI/CD pipeline.

### Prerequisites

To comfortably follow through this guideline, one should be comfortable with:

1. Web application development with [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [ExpressJS](https://expressjs.com/).
2. Using the CLI or command-line interface.
3. Using [git](https://git-scm.com/) commands. If you are not familiar with git commands, here is an article that higlights the [10 Git Commands Every Developer Should Know](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/10-important-git-commands-that-every-developer-should-know/).
4. One must have created a [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/) account.

**_These prerequisites will be used throughout this guideline. Make sure you have them installed to closely follow the demos._**
